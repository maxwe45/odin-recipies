         <p class="homemessage">These recipes will probably kill you except for the chicken broth that's just regular
            chicken broth. But the other ones I would say don't try, but the burger will probably make
            you sick and the salad will break your teeth. I can't say I have tried any of these except
            chicken broth obviously, so let me know if you try any so I know what it's like. Have a 
            good time cookin:)!!!
