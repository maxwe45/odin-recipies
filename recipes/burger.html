            <li>take the burger off the ground. Throw it on the burner just raw no pan or nothing 
                do it like a man its badass to get some charcoal flakes in there. I mean it makes
                the black burger more black what more do you want lol.
            </li>
            <li>I didn't say how long to do it bc idc and idk. Just take it off when it looks done
                -ish, and if its too raw idc eat it anyway maybe. It probably won't hurt you.
            </li>
            <li>now throw it on a bun the gross black bun. It should look disgusting thats cool.</li>
            <li>Throw some onion and bbq sauce on and you got the burger king black burger from 
                a few years ago!!!!
